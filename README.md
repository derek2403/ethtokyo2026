# ENSv2 Playground

One page for trying ENSv2 on **Sepolia**: register a `.eth` name, set records, create subnames, manage who can
do what with access-control policies and groups, and set your primary name.

> The ENSv2 contracts are **not final** and may change before mainnet. Addresses and ABIs are pinned to
> `ensdomains/contracts-v2@71a3b73`, the deployment the [ENS docs](https://docs.ens.domains/ensv2/overview) list.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

You need a browser wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, …) on Sepolia with a little Sepolia ETH for gas. Registration fees
are paid in test USDC, which you can mint for free on the page.

Optional: put `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=...` in `.env.local` to use your own RPC.

## What's on the page

1. **Get ready**: mint test USDC and deploy your own resolver (one per account; it holds your records).
2. **Register a .eth name**: price check, approve USDC, commit, wait ~1 minute, register.
3. **Your name**: status, owner, expiry, renew, point it at your resolver, set ETH address and text records.
4. **Subnames**: deploy a subname registry for your name and create subnames (`alice.yourname.eth`).
5. **Access control**:
   - *Policies* are named sets of permissions on a target: a name, your resolver (records), or a name's
     subname registry. Resolver policies can be limited to a single text key (e.g. only `avatar`).
   - *Groups* are named lists of addresses.
   - Grant or revoke a policy for a group (or one address) and see each member's current permissions.

   ENSv2's Enhanced Access Control stores roles per account on-chain; it has no built-in groups. Policies and
   groups are saved in your browser, and granting sends one transaction per member.
6. **Primary name**: set the name shown for your address (it must resolve back to your address).
7. **Look up**: resolve any name or address through the ENSv2 Universal Resolver.

To try access control end to end, use two wallets: grant a policy to the second wallet, switch to it, and make
the change it was granted (for example, edit a text record in section 3).
